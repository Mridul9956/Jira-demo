## Core Concepts in Jira:

### Project
A container that holds all related tasks, bugs, and features.  
**Example:** *E-commerce Website Project*

### Issue (or Ticket)
Any piece of work in Jira is called an **issue**.

**Types of Issues:**
- **Epic** → A big feature (e.g., *"Payment Integration"*)
- **Story** → A smaller feature under Epic (e.g., *"Add credit card option"*)
- **Task** → General work item (e.g., *"Update UI"*)
- **Bug** → A problem to be fixed (e.g., *"Login not working"*)

### Backlog
A list of pending tasks, stories, and bugs waiting to be worked on.

### Sprint
A fixed time-box (usually 2 weeks) where the team selects items from the backlog and works to complete them.

### Board (Scrum / Kanban)
Visual workflow of tasks → **To Do → In Progress → Done**  
Makes it easy to track progress.

### Workflow
The path an issue follows, like:  
**To Do → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done**

### Reports & Dashboards
Provides real-time charts (burn-down, velocity) to check team performance and project status.
